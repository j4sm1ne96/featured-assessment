Tasked with the following:

* Fix the "simple content" section, the block should be centralised
* Build a new block into the main section under the simple content section
* Image provided is the mock up of the block (Featured Block.png), please create the highlighted block (content left and image right)
* Pattern images are provided in the images file (the hero image can be used for the new block)
* Mobile image shows how the block should look on mobile. The block should be fully responsive.
* Freedom to create the block using any method you like
* Create hover styling for the button (you can get creative here but something simple like shrinking lines and colour changes is fine)
*JS Challenge - Add a button below the block which switches the image and content around to create the second section in the image provided (Featured Block.png, non highlighted block)
